# Driver_scoring_model
A model to assess and score a driver's risk level
#This is part of a project on driver scoring recommendation system built at my current company camanda technologies. All data used is made available publicly to work with as we plan to make this open source.

###
Introduction
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to assess driver risk levels. The model's output will be integrated into a PowerApps application to streamline the driver recommendation process in centralized or decentralized logistic and ride-hailing platforms. This automation will reduce manual decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

Target Audience

This documentation is intended for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anyone interested in applying machine learning to real-world problems.

Prerequisites

Hardware:
Google Colab (recommended for easy setup and access to GPU)
Local machine with 8GB RAM and 32GB storage
Software:
Python (version 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code
Required libraries: TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.
2. Data
Data Source:
The data was extracted from a data lake using a Medallion architecture. This approach allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of the data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Data Conversion: The data was converted from JSON format to Pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation and analysis.
Data Cleaning:
Removed missing values and empty spaces.
Handled outliers and anomalies.
Addressed data quality issues, such as inconsistencies or errors.
Feature Engineering:
Created new features based on existing ones, such as calculating average speed, acceleration, and braking distances.
Engineered features related to driving behavior, such as harsh acceleration and braking events.
Data Splitting:
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

3. Model Development
Feature Selection:

Correlation Analysis: Used to identify highly correlated features and eliminate redundant information.
Domain Knowledge: Leveraged domain expertise to select relevant features that impact driver risk.
Model Selection and Training:

Unsupervised Learning:
Clustering Algorithms: Used to group drivers into risk categories based on their driving behavior.
K-means Clustering: Applied to identify distinct clusters of low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk drivers.
Supervised Learning:
Classification Models: Trained on the labeled dataset to predict driver risk.
Random Forest: A robust algorithm capable of handling complex relationships between features.
XGBoost: A powerful algorithm known for its high accuracy and efficiency.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
Confusion Matrix: Visualized the model's predictions and actual labels.
ROC Curve: Plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

4. Integration with powerapps and Azure
This will be treated else where. since in this notebook, we have evaluated the right data and dataset (available in .csv format), it can be taken to a production environment where we will have a model.py, app.py, requirement.txt and a .yml file to dictate platform of deployment. Azure makes deployment easier as well as continuous integration and development
Challenges:

Data Quality: Real-time data can be noisy and inconsistent, requiring robust data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
Feature Engineering: Identifying the most relevant features and engineering them effectively can be challenging.
Model Interpretability: Understanding the underlying reasons for model predictions can be difficult, especially for complex models.
Future Work:

Continuous Learning: Implement a mechanism to continuously retrain the model with new data to improve its accuracy.
Advanced Techniques: Explore advanced techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning to further enhance the model's performance.
Explainable AI: Develop techniques to make the model's predictions more interpretable.
Real-time Monitoring: Monitor the model's performance in production and take corrective actions as needed.
By addressing these challenges and exploring future improvements, we can develop more accurate and reliable driver risk assessment models to enhance the safety and efficiency of transportation systems.
